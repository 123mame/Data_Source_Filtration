# Data_Source_Filtration
The problem was to find the data sources that had the least amount of information reporting deaths according to the cause of death, age group, and year in Bangladesh. The project aimed to decide which data sources to use for estimation, considering and by studying their limitations, strengths, and methods on the basis of least reported number of cause of death data sources. 

I tackled the problem by retrieving data from the database based on a selected list of Bangladeshi data sources. I then calculated the number of deaths and the proportion of each cause of death among these data sources. I created a heat map, similar to the attached picture, for discussion in our chekin hour for our team.

Although the problem was specific to Bangladesh, the identification of data sources could be valuable for other countries too. I made sure to create reusable code that could be used for future projects in different countries.
